<h1>moleculAR: An Augmented Reality Application for Understanding 3D Geometry</h1> 
<p>Welcome to MoleculAR, an augmented reality application that helps students understand 3D geometry in chemistry! We hope that MoleculAR will be a valuable tool for educators and students alike. To make it even easier to use, we've made all the QR codes for the structures available in the app free to download on our website. You can use these QR codes in any teaching capacity, whether you're a curious user looking to explore molecular geometry or an educator wishing to incorporate MoleculAR into your course syllabus.  Here's a quick guide on how to download and use the app:
</p>
  <ul> <li>Easy to use: Just scan a QR code and see the structure in AR.</li> <li>Interactive: Rotate, zoom, and explore the structure from different angles..</li> <li>Educational: Learn about the properties and functions of different molecules.</li> </ul>
