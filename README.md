MoleculAR: An Augmented Reality Application for Understanding 3D Geometry
<p>Welcome to MoleculAR, an augmented reality application that helps students understand 3D geometry in chemistry!
  All the QR codes for the structures available in the app free to download here: QRCodes. 
  You can use these QR codes in any learning capacity, whether you're a curious user looking to explore molecular geometry or an educator wishing to incorporate MoleculAR into your course syllabus.
  Here's a quick guide on how to download and use the app:
</p>
  <ul> <li>Step 1: Download the MoleculAR app from the App Store or Google Play Store on your smartphone or tablet device.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Open the app and select "START" to begin scanning the QR codes.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Scan the QR code for the molecule or orbital you want to view.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Explore the 3D model of the molecule or orbital that hovers over the QR Code. Rotate, zoom, and explore the structure from different angles.</li></ul> 
    
  
  <p>Thank you for choosing MoleculAR! We welcome any feedback you may have on the app and its use in chemistry education. We hope that MoleculAR will be a valuable tool for educators and students alike.</p>
